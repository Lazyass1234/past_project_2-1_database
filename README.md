# past_projects
2-1데이터베이스 과제: It is a shoppingmall database team project with html-php-sql. I heard a feedback from professor that it is too simple. Still my group implemented it well. When I was a sophomore first semester.

2-2 Machine Learning: It is a chess program project that tried to adapt machine learning algorithm. I tried to use 3 different algorithms, but everything failed. I specified my reckoning about my failed attempts at doc file. When I was a sophomore second semester.

2-2 Research Methodology: It is a research about to know that if project-based courses such as using arduino or raspberry pi is actually boost their computational thinking skills or not. I think I did well about quantitative one, but I wasn't good at qualitative one in my point of view. When I was a sophomore second semester.

3-1 StockMarketPrediction: It is a project to compare LSTM and GRU both for predict my country's stock market KOSPI. I had to made the metadata by myself, but I was lucky that find a module for that. It showed that GRU was good at forecasting stockmarket compared to LSTM. When I was a Junior first semester.

3-1 Urban Sound: It is a team project to classifying urban noises. But it went completely bad, because we failed to use the dataset in proper correct way. When I was a Junior first semester.
