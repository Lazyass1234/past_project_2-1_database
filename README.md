2-1 Database: It is a shoppingmall database team project with html-php-sql. I heard a feedback from professor that it is too simple. Still my group implemented it well. When I was a sophomore first semester.
2-1 데이터베이스: html-php-sql로 만든 쇼핑몰 팀프로젝트입니다. 너무 간단하다고 교수님에게 피드백을 들었습니다. 그래도 우리 그룹은 잘 구현했습니다. 2학년 1학기 때 프로젝트입니다.

2-2 Machine Learning: It is a chess program project that tried to adapt machine learning algorithm. I tried to use 3 different algorithms, but everything failed. I specified my reckoning about my failed attempts at doc file. When I was a sophomore second semester.
2-2 머신 러닝: 머신 러닝 알고리즘을 적용해보고자 한 체스 프로그램 프로젝트 입니다. 세 가지 다른 알고리즘을 사용했지만, 모두 실패했었습니다. doc 파일에 왜 제 시도들이 실패했었는지에 대한 생각을 적었습니다. 2학년 2학기 때 프로젝트입니다.

2-2 Research Methodology: It is a research about to know that if project-based courses such as using arduino or raspberry pi is actually boost their computational thinking skills or not. I think I did well about quantitative one, but I wasn't good at qualitative one in my point of view. When I was a sophomore second semester.
2-2 연구 방법론: 

3-1 StockMarketPrediction: It is a project to compare LSTM and GRU both for predict my country's stock market KOSPI. I had to made the metadata by myself, but I was lucky that find a module for that. It showed that GRU was good at forecasting stockmarket compared to LSTM. When I was a Junior first semester.

3-1 Urban Sound: It is a team project to classifying urban noises. But it went completely bad, because we failed to use the dataset in proper correct way. When I was a Junior first semester.
